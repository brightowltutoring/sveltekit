He understands the people he is tutoring and makes changes to help us understand what we are learning so we can do the best that we possibly can and heâ€™s just a great person to chat with!",

      body: "Finding a steady and solid tutor to help my daughter in grade 12 physics had been a hassle in the last two years. Although reluctant to try out online tutoring Jon came as a recommendation to me from Rachel's private school. Jon was incredibly flexible, down to weekend hours, and exceeded my expectations of what was possible online (I shadowed a few sessions Jon :D !). The mock test sessions were especially crucial in improving Rachel's grades! Cannot recommend enough!",

      body: "Jon explained the mechanics behind every question I had trouble with in thorough detail. If I had difficulty understanding his explanation, he would use another way to represent his knowledge such as drawing pictures and using diagrams. he taught me measurements, mechanics, waves, electromagnetism, nuclear and thermal physics. He was also a big help with my physics IA! He also made my solution space a place where I could look back if I've forgotten something.",
